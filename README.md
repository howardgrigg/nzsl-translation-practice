## How to Use

### üé¨ Interpretation Practice Mode
1. **Watch the video** - NZSL sentences will loop automatically (use speed controls if needed)
2. **Type your interpretation** - What do you think the signed sentence means?
3. **Submit for scoring** - Claude AI will score your translation (0-10) and provide feedback
4. **Review results** - See how your interpretation compares to the official translation
5. **Explore sign details** - Click on any sign in the sequence to see definition videos
6. **Track progress** - View your practice history and improvement statistics
7. **Next video** - Click the green "Next Video" button to practice with a new sentence

### üß© Grammar Practice Mode
1. **Read the English sentence** - Understand what needs to be translated into NZSL
2. **Drag and drop words** - Arrange the provided NZSL glosses in the correct order
3. **Use position indicators** - Visual guides show where words will be placed
4. **Get hints if needed** - Video examples available (2-point penalty)
5. **Submit your answer** - See partial scoring with ‚úÖ/‚ùå feedback between words
6. **Review correct order** - Click on glosses in the correct answer to see definitions
7. **Continue practicing** - Work through 10-question sessions

### üåê Navigation
- **Switch tabs** - Use "üìπ Interpretation Practice" and "üß© Grammar Practice" tabs
- **Direct linking** - Share specific modes: 
  - Grammar: `http://localhost:20254/#grammar`
  - Interpretation: `http://localhost:20254/#interpretation`

### Features in Detail

- **Speed Control** (Interpretation): Toggle between normal and half-speed playback
- **Drag & Drop** (Grammar): Advanced interface with reordering and duplicate word handling
- **Interpretation History**: All attempts are saved locally in your browser
- **Progress Tracking**: See total interpretations, average score, and improvement trends
- **Clickable Glosses**: Tap any sign gloss to view definition videos in popup modal

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Backend**: Flask server (Python) with SQLite database and Claude API integration
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with advanced DOM manipulation
- **Data Storage**: SQLite database with 5,347+ NZSL sentences and sign definitions
- **Videos**: Streamed directly from AWS S3 (NZSL dictionary hosting)
- **AI Model**: Claude 3.5 Haiku for semantic scoring and personalized feedback
- **Client Storage**: localStorage for interpretation history and progress tracking

### Data Structure

#### Interpretation Practice Data
Each video example includes:
- Video URL (AWS S3 hosted)
- Official English translation
- Enhanced sign sequence with definition videos
- Common word rank (based on frequency research)
- Dictionary word ID for cross-referencing

#### Grammar Practice Data
Each sentence example includes:
- English sentence for translation
- NZSL gloss sequence with sign IDs
- Parsed sign data for clickable glosses
- Video examples for hints
- Structured for partial scoring algorithm

### Scoring Systems

#### AI Interpretation Scoring (Claude 3.5 Haiku)
Evaluates interpretations based on:
- **Semantic meaning similarity** - understanding core concepts
- **Context awareness** - recognizing perspective (I/you/they)
- **Flexible interpretation** - allowing valid alternative phrasings
- **Communication success** - prioritizing meaning over exact wording
- **Encouraging feedback** - providing constructive guidance for improvement

#### Grammar Partial Scoring Algorithm
Advanced consecutive joins scoring:
- **Exact match bonus** - Full points for perfect word order
- **Consecutive segments** - Partial credit for correct word sequences
- **Position awareness** - Rewards properly placed word groups
- **Hint penalties** - 2-point deduction for video assistance
- **Real-time feedback** - Emoji indicators show correct/incorrect joins

### Data Sources
- **Video content**: NZSL.nz dictionary (Deaf Studies Research Unit, Victoria University of Wellington)
- **Grammar sentences**: NZSL.nz sentence corpus (5,347+ examples)
- **Sign frequency**: McKee, D., & Kennedy, G. D. (2006). The distribution of signs in New Zealand sign language. *Sign Language Studies*, *6*(4), 372-390.
- **Database structure**: Comprehensive SQLite database with signs, videos, examples, and definitions

## API Costs

The app uses Claude 3.5 Haiku for interpretation scoring (grammar practice is client-side):
- **Input**: $1.00 per 1M tokens
- **Output**: $5.00 per 1M tokens
- **Typical interpretation scoring**: ~$0.001-0.002 per attempt
- **Grammar practice**: No API costs (local scoring algorithm)
- **Usage tracking**: Built-in cost monitoring in the Flask app

## Notes

- **Data Privacy**: All practice history is stored locally in your browser (localStorage)
- **Internet Required**: Videos stream from external hosting, interpretation scoring requires API access
- **Offline Grammar**: Grammar practice works offline (no API required)
- **No Registration**: No user accounts or server-side data storage
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design with touch-optimized drag-and-drop
- **PWA Support**: Can be installed as an app on mobile devices and desktop
