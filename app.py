Original signed sentence signs: {signs_text}
Official English translation: "{original_translation}"
User's interpretation: "{user_translation}"

IMPORTANT: Read the user's interpretation VERY carefully before scoring. The user is interpreting what they saw signed in the video. When the signer uses "I" in the original, the user should also use "I" in their interpretation - this shows they correctly understood the signer was talking about their own experience. The user is translating/interpreting, not describing what they observed.

Before scoring, carefully check if the user's interpretation contains the same key information as the official translation, even if worded differently.

Please score this interpretation on a scale of 0-10 where:
- 10 = Perfect or near-perfect meaning match (minor differences like "I" vs "i", "nine" vs "9" don't matter)
- 9 = Excellent - captures all meaning with very minor wording differences
- 8 = Very good - captures main meaning with small differences  
- 6-7 = Good - captures core idea but misses some details
- 4-5 = Partially correct but significant gaps
- 2-3 = Some elements correct but major misunderstanding
- 0-1 = Completely incorrect or unrelated

BE ACCURATE with scoring. If the user's interpretation is about completely different topics or concepts than the original, score it very low (0-2). Only give high scores when the interpretations are actually about the same topic and events.

Focus on semantic meaning rather than exact word-for-word matching. Minor differences in capitalization, numbers vs words (9 vs nine), or slight rephrasing should not reduce the score if the meaning is the same. Examples of equivalent meanings: "burglar/intruder/scary person", "phone/call/ring", "neighbour/neighbor", "arrived home/got home/came home".

Use encouraging, friendly language. Address the learner directly as "you". Focus on what they got right first, then gently explain what could be improved. Use phrases like "Excellent work!", "Perfect interpretation!", "You nailed it!", "Good catch on...", "You understood...".

CRITICAL: Before giving feedback about what the user "missed", double-check that they actually missed it. Do not claim they missed something that is clearly present in their interpretation.

REALITY CHECK: Ask yourself - are the user's interpretation and the official translation actually about the same topic/situation? If not, do not try to find connections that don't exist. Be honest about significant misunderstandings.

Respond with ONLY a JSON object in this format:
{{"score": X, "feedback": "Encouraging explanation addressing the learner directly about what they captured well and what to focus on next time"}}"""
